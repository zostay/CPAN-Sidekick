v0.1 vc3 2012-02-08 Release

 * Original release
 * Search for CPAN modules
 * See search results with the author's picture, module abstract, ratings, and favorites.
 * Tap on individual results to see the documentation for that module.
 * Follow links within the documentation to see the documentation for other modules.
 * Any link to something other than a module will work, but will go to a browser, even if that link is within CPAN. (Eventually, we hope to change this.)Ê
